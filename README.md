# password-generator
A starter code for a password generator that I edited in order to allow the user to put specifications they want for their password.

## Built With
The web application was built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features
The password generator will generate a random password between 8-128 characters by asking a series of questions.

## Visuals
The application will appear like this when deployed:

<img
  src="password-generator.png"
  alt="password-generator"
  title="Password Generator"
  style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 300px">
